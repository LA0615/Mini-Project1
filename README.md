# Mini-Project1

Website layout with contact buttons.

This is a rough template for a future website so that employers can contact me via email. They can see my portfolio and github as well. 
This was built to practice HTML and CSS code that I have learned in class thus far. 
I learned how to create padding and margins for an image. I also learned how to add colors , a header, and a footer for this webpage.
